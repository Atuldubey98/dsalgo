Definition :  Breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.

1 Solving those subproblems and simply storing the results
2 Reuse those stored results if subproblems occurs
3 Finally using solutions to smaller problems to solutions to bigger problems

1+1+1+1
We have to count it to 4. But if we put +1 now we will get the answer as 5. This is dynamic Programming.
It is optimization over recursion
DP = recursion+memorization
eg = fibonacci series
fibo(0) = 0
fibo(1) = 1
fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
